                    <h4>ProccS:</h4>    
                    ProccS is a tool for simulating occupancy profiles for private households. 
                    The tool is based on the article: 

                    <ul>
                      <li><cite>Wolf, S. Cal√¨, Madsen, H. et al. (2019) Domestic Occupancy Simulation on Room-level (under review)</cite></li>
                    </ul>

                    The application creates occupancy profiles for bathroom, kitchen, living room and bedrooms. The profiles can be downloaded in csv-format. 

                    The underlying model is based on a inhomogeneous Markov chain.
                    It was trained on time-use data of Danish households from 2008/2009.

                    The tool was developed at the Techincal University of Denmark in the Dynamical Systems group (<a href="https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/dynsys" class="card-link">DTU DynSys</a>).

                    <h4>Assumptions and limitations:</h4>

                    <ul>
                                                    

                        <li>At every time point, each occupant is in either of the following states: (1) bedroom, (2) kitchen, (3) bathroom, (4) living room, (5) not present.</li>

                        <li>Occupants access only their own bedroom.</li>

                        <li>Each occupant moves independently.</li>
                        
                        <li>Differences of occupancy for different days of the week are taken into account.</li>
                        <li>No holidays are considered.</li>

                        <li>The rooms are accessed by the household members only. No visitors are considered.</li>

                        <li>Currently, each household has exactly one bathroom.</li>

                        <li>ProccS is meant for simulating private households only. For office environments, refer to
